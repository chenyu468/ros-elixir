  An implementation of the ROS Slave API Behaviour from
  `ROS.SlaveApi.Behaviour`.

  Note that, as a change from the Slave API as defined
  [at the ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Slave_API), all of these functions
  are underscore notation. This sacrifices a small amount of consistency for
  the sake of the Elixir style guide.
